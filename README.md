Programming problems and solutions 

You are given two strings s and t that consist only of lower-case letters. String t was created by adding one letter chosen at random to string s, then shuffling the resulting string. Find the letter that was added to t. For instance, the difference between the two strings “abcdef” and “bfxdeac” is the character “x”.

Your task is to write a program to find the random letter that was added to the string
